# Scale-Shapes

The program will ask the user if they would like to add a new circle, new triangle, new right triangle, delete a shape, delete all shappes,
display all shapes, move a shape, enter a scale factor, sclae all shapes, or if they would like to exit. The program will calcualte
things associated to those shapes.

This allows you to add shapes in an array using abstract methods. User can get the area, perimeter, hypotenuse, and also scale
the shapes that were entered from user.

The user can also set an ID for each shape as well as create an X location associated with a Y location, and also are able to edit
the locations if the users wishes.
